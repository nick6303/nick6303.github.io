                        <br> - 2010 - now Thread Count Lab
                        <br> Co—Founder, Publisher and Managing Editor Founded by textile designer-artists Eleanor—Jayne Browne and Alessia Giardino, graduates from Central Saint Martins’ prestigious MA Design for Textile Futures, Thread Count Lab is an interdisciplinary design collective that makes objects, events and exhibitions which foreground materiality.
                        <br>
                        <br> The Thread Count Lab collection is an ongoing assemblage of material—objects that foregrounds materials and explores their senso—aesthetics. The Lab is a lovingly curated evolving sketchbook of thoughts: a visual essay of collected inspirations. Rooted in design exploration we are also engaged in academic research, as well as artistic practices, and welcome partners from all areas of art and design.

                    <p>
                        Founded by Eleanor-Jayne Browne, The D/sign Lounge is a Lab with a difference: we break the boundaries of current thinking– from both a theoretical and applied angle– we are the point where design, (style) and research intersect.
                        <br>
                        <br>As The Media+Visual Communication Department’s Flagship Lab, our wide-ranging activities are rooted in design education and projects conducted by us vary from NSC Taiwan Government supported research to education and industry collaborations. We have won several awards and our core specialties include Branding, Bio-inspiration, Printmaking, Future Textiles and Materiality. However, because of our unique skills (and curiosity) we regularly engage in exploratory projects and bi-annually host inter-disciplinary workshops with guests from the international art and design community.
