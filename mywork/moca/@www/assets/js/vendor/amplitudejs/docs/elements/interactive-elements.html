<h1 id="interactive-elements">Interactive Elements</h1>
<p>The interactive elements of Amplitude.js have event handlers bound to them that
responds to a touch or click from a user. These elements build the functionality
of the player you are designing. The scoping of these elements is handled by
attributes that define the level of functionality each element has such as
global, playlist, individual song. These are outlined in detail for each element.</p>
<h2 id="play-button">Play Button</h2>
<p>There are 3 different levels for a play button.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global Play - Plays the current song whether it&#39;s an individual song or in a
playlist</li>
<li>Playlist Play - Plays the current song in the playlist.</li>
<li>Song Play - Plays an individual song whether it&#39;s in a playlist or by itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>The play button responds to the &#39;click&#39; event on a desktop or a &#39;touchstart&#39;
event on mobile.</p>
<h3 id="global-play-button">Global Play Button</h3>
<p>The global play button will play the active song whether or not the song is an
individual song or in a playlist. To add a global play button simply an HTML
element with the class &#39;amplitude-play&#39;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-play&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="playlist-play-button">Playlist Play Button</h3>
<p>The playlist play button will play the active song in the playlist or it will
play the first song in the playlist if the playlist is out of scope (meaning
another playlist was being played or it&#39;s the first playlist being played). To
add a playlist play button, add an HTML element with the class of
&#39;amplitude-play&#39; and the attribute &#39;amplitude-playlist=&quot;playlist_index&quot;&#39;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-play&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;playlist_index&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="individual-song-play-button">Individual Song Play Button</h3>
<p>The individual song play button will play the song defined by the &#39;amplitude-song-index=&quot;song_index&quot;&#39; attribute.
You can also add an &#39;amplitude-playlist=&quot;playlist_index&quot;&#39; attribute to the
element which will play an individual song in the playlist.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-play&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To play song index 1 in playlist &quot;test_playlist&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-play&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;1&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;test_playlist&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="pause-button">Pause Button</h2>
<p>Like the play button, the pause button has 3 different levels.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global Pause - Pauses the active song no matter if it&#39;s individual or in a
playlist.</li>
<li>Playlist Pause - Pauses the active song in the playlist.</li>
<li>Song Pause - Pauses an individual song in a playlist or by itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>The pause button responds to the &#39;click&#39; event on a desktop or a &#39;touchstart&#39;
event on mobile.</p>
<h3 id="global-pause">Global Pause</h3>
<p>The global pause button will pause whatever song is currently playing. To add a
global pause button simply add an HTML element with the class of &#39;amplitude-pause&#39;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-pause&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="playlist-pause">Playlist Pause</h3>
<p>The playlist pause button will pause the active song in the playlist. It only
works if the playlist defined in the attribute is playing the song.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-pause&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;test_playlist&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="individual-song-pause">Individual Song Pause</h3>
<p>The individual song pause button will pause the song defined by the attribute &#39;amplitude-song-index=&quot;song_index&quot;&#39;. If you want an individual song in a
playlist to add the &#39;amplitude-playlist=&quot;test_playlist&quot;&#39; attribute to the element
and Amplitude.js will pause that individual song in the playlist when clicked.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-pause&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to pause song index 3 in the playlist &quot;test_playlist&quot;</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-pause&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;3&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;test_playlist&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="play-pause-button">Play Pause Button</h2>
<p>The play/pause button is probably the most common button to be implemented when
working with Amplitude.js. Depending on the global state, playlist state and/or
song state, this element will get a class that is &#39;amplitude-playing&#39; or
&#39;amplitude-paused&#39; that can be styled accordingly. It&#39;s common to set a play or
pause button image as a background in CSS so when the interaction occurs, the
proper button appears.</p>
<p>There are 3 levels of Play/Pause buttons.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global Play/Pause - Plays or pauses the active song no matter if it&#39;s
independent or part of a playlist.</li>
<li>Playlist Play/Pause - Plays or pauses the active song in the scope of the playlist.</li>
<li>Song Play/Pause - Plays or pauses an individual song.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="global-play-pause">Global Play/Pause</h3>
<p>The global play pause button plays or pauses the current song depending on the
state of the AmplitudeJS player. This button does not account for whether the
song is in a playlist or an individual song, it&#39;s whatever song is active the
functionality works on.  To add a global play/pause button you add an element
and give the property of &#39;amplitude-main-play-pause=&quot;true&quot;&#39;:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;button amplitude-play-pause&quot; amplitude-main-play-pause=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="playlist-play-pause">Playlist Play/Pause</h3>
<p>The playlist play pause button plays or pauses the current song in a playlist.
If a song is being played outside of a playlist when clicked, the playlist will
play the first song in the playlist assigned to the button clicked and pause the
other song. To add a playlist play pause button add an element with the class of &#39;amplitude-play-pause&#39; an attribute of &#39;amplitude-playlist-main-play-pause=&quot;true&quot;&#39;
and an attribute of &#39;amplitude-playlist=&quot;{playlist-index}&#39;.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;button amplitude-play-pause amplitude-paused&quot; amplitude-playlist-main-play-pause=&quot;true&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;{index}&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="song-play-pause">Song Play/Pause</h3>
<p>The song play pause button plays or pauses the song clicked. This can either be
in a playlist or an individual song. If the song is in a playlist you will have
to add an attribute stating the playlist with the playlist key. The element will
also have to have an attribute of the song index on the element.</p>
<p>Playlist Song:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;button amplitude-play-pause&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;{song_index}&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;{song_playlist}&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Individual Song:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;button amplitude-play-pause amplitude-paused&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;{song_index}&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="stop-button">Stop Button</h2>
<p>The stop button simply stops the active song. On a desktop, this will respond to
the &#39;click&#39; event and a &#39;touchstart&#39; on mobile. To add a stop button simply add
the following HTML element:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-stop&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="mute-button">Mute Button</h2>
<p>The mute button is another global element that mutes the active song. On a
desktop, this element will respond to the &#39;click&#39; event and a &#39;touchstart&#39; on
mobile.
There are two classes that get added to the mute button so you can style it
according to the state of the player.</p>
<p>When the player is not muted the class &#39;amplitude-not-muted&#39; is added to the
element and &#39;amplitude-muted&#39; is added when the player is muted.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-mute&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="volume-up">Volume Up</h2>
<p>The volume up button increments the volume by the amount defined in the config.
By default the increment is 5. To change the increment you must adjust the
volume_increment setting in the Amplitude.init() method. This element will
respond to a &#39;click&#39; on desktop or a &#39;touchstart&#39; event on mobile. On iPhones,
the user can not adjust the volume through the web page. To add a volume up
element add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-volume-up&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="volume-down">Volume Down</h2>
<p>The volume down button decrements the volume by the amount defined in the
config. By default the decrement is 5. To change the increment you must adjust
the volume_decrement setting in the Amplitude.init() method. This element will
respond to a &#39;click&#39; on desktop or a &#39;touchstart&#39; event on mobile. On iPhones,
the user can not adjust the volume through the web page. To add a volume up
element add:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-volume-down&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="volume-slider">Volume Slider</h2>
<p>The volume slider is an HTML 5 range input element. This allows the user to
slide the volume to where they want. On desktop and mobile,
this element listens to a &#39;change&#39; or &#39;input&#39; event. It will not work on iPhones
since iOS doesn&#39;t allow the user to adjust the volume through anything but the
volume up and down hardware buttons. To add a volume slider, add the following
HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; class=&quot;amplitude-volume-slider&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="next-button">Next Button</h2>
<p>Amplitude.js extends functionality for the audio tag by allowing designers and
developers to build playlists. When a next button has been added Amplitude.js
will go to the next song in the state of the player. There are two versions of
the next button.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global Next -&gt; Will go to the next song in the state no matter what state
the player is in.</li>
<li>Playlist Next -&gt; Will go to the next song in the playlist no matter the
state.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next button will either go sequentially down the indexes or the next index
in the shuffled songs array. If the player is playing a playlist, then the
global next button will operate on that playlist.</p>
<p>To add a global next button add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-next&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To add a playlist next button add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-next&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;playlist_key&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The playlist next button has an amplitude-playlist attribute with the key for
the playlist it&#39;s corresponding to.</p>
<h2 id="previous-button">Previous Button</h2>
<p>Similar to the next button, the previous button goes to the previous song in the
state of the player. There are two versions of the previous button.</p>
<ol>
<li>Global Prev -&gt; Will go to the previous song in the state no matter what state
the player is in.</li>
<li>Playlist Prev -&gt; Will go to the previous song in the playlist no matter the
state.</li>
</ol>
<p>The previous button will go sequentilly down the indexes or to the previous
index in the shuffled songs array. If the player is playing a playlist,
the global previous button will operate on that playlist.</p>
<p>To add a global previous button add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-prev&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To add a playlist previous button add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-prev&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;playlist_key&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The playlist previous button has an amplitude-playlist attribute with the key
for the playlist it&#39;s corresponding to.</p>
<h2 id="shuffle-button">Shuffle Button</h2>
<p>The shuffle button is also an extension of functionality added by Amplitude.js.
It allows the developer/user to shuffle songs in a playlist or on a global level.
Playlists can have shuffle states indpendant of other playlists. When a song
ends or the user goes to the next song, Amplitude.js will know whether or not
the playlist should go to the next sequential user defined song or the next song
in the shuffle array.  When a playlist is shuffled or the global songs are
shuffled a class of &#39;amplitude-shuffle-on&#39; is applied to the element where if
shuffle is turned off &#39;ampltiude-shuffle-off&#39; is applied to the element.</p>
<p>To add a shuffle button add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-shuffle&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>To add a playlist shuffle button add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-shuffle&quot; amplitude-playliste=&quot;playlist_key&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This shuffle button contains the attribute that defines the playlist key. This
will shuffle only the playlist defined.</p>
<h2 id="repeat-button">Repeat Button</h2>
<p>The repeat button, when active, will repeat the entire songs array when the
there are no songs. This is a global level element. The button can be styled
based off of the state of the classes applied to the button. When repeat is not
on, the button will have a class of &#39;amplitude-repeat-off&#39; applied to the
element and when repeat is on, the class &#39;amplitude-repeat-on&#39; applied to the
class.</p>
<p>To add the repeat button, add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-repeat&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="repeat-song">Repeat Song</h3>
<p>The repeat song button, when active, will repeat the individual song when the
song has ended. The button can be styled based off of the sate of classes
applied to the button. When the repeat is not on, the button will have a class
of &#39;amplitude-repeat-song-off&#39; and when on, &#39;amplitude-repeat-song-on&#39;.</p>
<p>To add the repeat song button, add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-repeat-song&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="playback-speed-button">Playback Speed Button</h2>
<p>The playback speed button controls how fast the audio is played back through
Amplitude.js. There are 3 speeds.</p>
<ol>
<li>&#39;1.0&#39; which is the base speed.</li>
<li>&#39;1.5&#39; which is 1.5x as fast</li>
<li>&#39;2.0&#39; which is 2x as fast</li>
</ol>
<p>When clicked, the playback speed button will add a class representing the speed
the player is playing back at. The classes can be styled as well and are as
follows:</p>
<p>&#39;1.0&#39; = &#39;amplitude-playback-speed-10&#39;
&#39;1.5&#39; = &#39;amplitude-playback-speed-15&#39;
&#39;2.0&#39; = &#39;amplitude-playback-speed-20&#39;</p>
<p>To add a playback speed button simply add the following HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-playback-speed&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="skip-to-link">Skip To Link</h2>
<p>The skip to links allow the user to define spots in the audio like bookmarks
that can be skipped to. They can reference a song in a playlist or an individual
song depending on the attributes. If you want to link to a song in a playlist,
you have to add the attribute &#39;amplitude-song-index=&quot;index&quot;&#39; and &#39;amplitude-playlist=&quot;playlist&quot;&#39;. To make the skip work, you will also have to
add an attribute &#39;amplitude-location=&quot;seconds&quot;&#39; to link to in the song.</p>
<p>An example song link would be:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;span class=&quot;amplitude-skip-to&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;7&quot; amplitude-location=&quot;30&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;rock&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>This link will go to the song at index 7 on the playlist rock and the location
of 30 seconds into the song.</p>
<h2 id="song-tracking-slider-html-5-range-">Song Tracking Slider (HTML 5 Range)</h2>
<p>The easiest way to implement song tracking is through an HTML 5 Range slider.
The sliding functionality is already taken care of for you and it provides a
smooth UX. There are some downfalls with this element since you can&#39;t style the
before and after pieces. We also have an HTML 5 progress element that allows for
easy styling of before and after but requires some custom JS to update the
interaction. No worries, though the tutorial will be linked!</p>
<p>Note that features like the tracking slider and progress bar depend on the
browser being able to request the audio file in arbitrary chunks. Firefox can
work around lack of support from the server, but for these features to work
properly, your server must support
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Range">Content-Range HTTP headers</a>.</p>
<p>To add a song slider, add the following element:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; class=&quot;amplitude-song-slider&quot; amplitude-main-song-slider=&quot;true&quot; step=&quot;.1&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The class name is <code>amplitude-song-slider</code>. You can also add
<code>amplitude-main-song-slider=&quot;true&quot;</code> if you want it to reference the current song
no matter what. If you want to do an individual playlist, you can add the
attributes of <code>amplitude-playlist-song-slider=&quot;true&quot;</code>
and <code>amplitude-playlist=&quot;{playlistKey}&quot;</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; class=&quot;amplitude-song-slider&quot; amplitude-playlist-song-slider=&quot;true&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;{playlistKey}&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You can also add a song slider for an individual song like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; class=&quot;amplitude-song-slider&quot; amplitude-playlist=&quot;{playlistKey}&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;{songIndex}&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;input type=&quot;range&quot; class=&quot;amplitude-song-slider&quot; amplitude-song-index=&quot;{songIndex}&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>The first of the individual song examples is for a playlist, the second is for
an individual song.</p>
<h2 id="song-progress-bar">Song Progress Bar</h2>
<p>In AmplitudeJS 3.2, we added the song progress bar. This allows the user further
customization over the design. It essentially replaces the song time
visualization that was removed in this release. These operate the same as the
range except you will have to implement your own slider event handling. I wrote
a quick tutorial on that here: <a href="https://serversideup.net/set-song-played-percentage-amplitudejs/">https://serversideup.net/set-song-played-percentage-amplitudejs/</a>.</p>
<p>To add a song progress bar, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;progress id=&quot;song-played-progress&quot; class=&quot;amplitude-song-played-progress&quot; amplitude-main-song-played-progress=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;
</code></pre>
<h2 id="song-buffered-progress-bar">Song Buffered Progress Bar</h2>
<p>In AmplitudeJS 3.2, we added the song buffered progress bar. This allows for a
visual display of how much of the song has been buffered. You can do some CSS
techniques to overlay this progress element over the song-played-progress
element to make an all in one, or you could leave it by itself.  </p>
<p>To add a song buffered progress element, add the following:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-html">&lt;progress id=&quot;song-buffered-progress&quot; class=&quot;amplitude-buffered-progress&quot; value=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/progress&gt;
</code></pre>
