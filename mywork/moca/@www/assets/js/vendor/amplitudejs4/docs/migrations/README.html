<h1 id="upgrading-from-3-x-to-4-0">Upgrading from 3.x To 4.0</h1>
<p>AmplitudeJS 4.0 was one of the biggest releases thus far. We tried to limit the breaking changes, but in order to scale for the future we had to make a few.  I should have every change documented below and the reason why the change was made.</p>
<h2 id="all-amplitudejs-attributes-have-html5-dataset-prefix">All AmplitudeJS Attributes Have HTML5 Dataset Prefix</h2>
<p>In order to make AmplitudeJS validated properly by w3 terms, we prefixed all of the attributes on AmplitudeJS elements to have the <code>data-</code> prefix. This makes all of the attributes compatible with the HTML5 dataset API: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/dataset</a></p>
<p>What this means is any time you are defining a specific element for a song or playlist, you will have to use <code>data-amplitude-song-index</code> or <code>data-amplitude-playlist</code>. In 3.x releases, these were just <code>amplitude-song-index</code> or <code>amplitude-playlist</code>. In order to work with 4.0 and above, you will have to update these references.</p>
<h2 id="standard-attributes-for-defining-elements">Standard Attributes For Defining Elements</h2>
<p>In versions 3.x, we had a variety of different attributes to define an element based on it&#39;s level of use. For example, if we had a global play/pause button it&#39;d be <code>amplitude-main-play-pause=&quot;true&quot;</code> as an attribute. This got really cumbersome with multiple elements existing on either a global level (controlling the entire player), a playlist level (controlling functions within a playlist), a song level (controlling an individual song), and a song in playlist level (controlling a song within a playlist). Now everything is based on a combination of attributes. These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Global Level: <code>class=&quot;amplitude-{specialized-class}&quot;</code></li>
<li>Playlist Level: <code>class=&quot;amplitude-{specialized-class}&quot; data-amplitude-playlist=&quot;{playlist}&quot;</code></li>
<li>Song Level: <code>class=&quot;amplitude-{specialized-class}&quot; data-amplitude-song-index=&quot;{songIndex}&quot;</code></li>
<li>Song In Playlist: <code>class=&quot;amplitude-{specialized-class}&quot; data-amplitude-song-index=&quot;{songIndex}&quot; data-amplitude-playlist=&quot;{playlist}&quot;</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These combinations work for all elements that are in AmplitudeJS. Now there are some elements that don&#39;t span all of the scopes. Let&#39;s take an <code>amplitude-volume-up</code> element. This only works on the global level. It wouldn&#39;t make sense to have individual playlist volumes.</p>
<h2 id="playlist-song-indexes-are-scoped-to-playlist">Playlist Song Indexes Are Scoped To Playlist</h2>
<p>In versions 3.x song indexes are now scoped to playlists. What this means is that when you use <code>data-amplitude-song-index</code> on a song display IN a playlist, it references the index of the song in the playlist instead of the songs array. For example if song index 1 is used on the &#39;Hip Hop&#39; playlist, it references song index 1 within that playlist. Before it was the index in the songs array.</p>
<h2 id="next-and-previous-buttons-only-work-in-playlists-if-playlist-is-active">Next And Previous Buttons Only Work In Playlists If Playlist Is Active</h2>
<p>So there are two levels of next and previous buttons. The global level which will react to the state of the player and the playlist level. If a global level next button or previous button is clicked, it will either go to the next/previous song in the songs array if no playlist is active, or the next/previous song in the playlist if a playlist is active.  Now on the playlist level the buttons only go to the next/previous song in the playlist when clicked and ONLY if the playlist is active. If you click a next/previous button on a playlist that isn&#39;t active, it doesn&#39;t do anything. It will only print a debug message if debug is turned on.</p>
<h2 id="autoplay-configuration-has-been-removed">Autoplay Configuration Has Been Removed</h2>
<p>Most browsers do not support autoplay features anymore. The functionality to set up AmplitudeJS for autoplay has been removed. If you initialize with autoplay, it will just be ignored.</p>
<p>That should be the migrations! If you ran into anything, please reach out and we can lend a hand!</p>
